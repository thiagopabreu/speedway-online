# Versioning

As npm packages only support three digits of [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning),
the package version **does not match the editor version**.
Only the first two digits match the editor, the rest should be seen as a "package version".

# Building

```
npm i
npm run build
```
